- Node is ideally used to build Highly-scalable, data-intensive, real-time back-end services bases applications
- Nodejs is one of the most powerful and popular server technology. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is the core of Nodejs
- Node/Nodejs is open source server environment, it uses JavaScript on server
- Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime/code built on Google Chromes V8 javascript runtime engine. The V8 engine is written in C++ language which takes node(javascript) code and quickly compile/convert to machine code
