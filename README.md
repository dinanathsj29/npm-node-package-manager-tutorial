1 Introduction to Node-Nodejs
=====================

1.1. What is Node-Nodejs
---------------------

- Node is a cross-platform, open-source runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser i.e. at the server. We often use Node to build back-end services ie. API (Application Programming Interface)
- Node is ideally used to build Highly-scalable, data-intensive, real-time back-end services bases applications
- Nodejs is one of the most powerful and popular server technology. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is the core of Nodejs
- Node/Nodejs is open source server environment, it uses JavaScript on server
- Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime/code built on Google Chromes V8 javascript runtime engine. The V8 engine is written in C++ language which takes node(javascript) code and quickly compile/convert to machine code
- Nodejs can be defined/described with the following important terms:
  - Asynchronous
  - Non-blocking
  - Event-Based
  - Single thread / Single threaded

1.2. Why Node
---------------------

- Great for prototyping and agile development
- Super-fast and highly scalable
- Non-blocking - Asynchronous nature (more tasks/code run at a time)
- JavaScript is a programming language used everywhere (Front-end + Back-end)
- Cleaner and more consistent codebase/source code
- The largest ecosystem of open-source libraries
- Great open-source community support

1.3. What Node can do
---------------------

Node/Nodejs can perform/do the following important things:
- Generate Dynamic page content
- Can Create, Open, Read, Write, Delete files on the server
- Collect Form Data
- Can perform CRUD (Create-Add, Read, Update-Edit/Modify, Delete) operation in Database

1.4. Installing Node
---------------------
1.4. Installing Node/NPM
---------------------
1.4. Install/Setup Node/NPM
---------------------

In this section, we will learn how to set up a local development environment by installing Node/NPM:

1. Download and Install latest node (node comes with npm) (website: https://nodejs.org/en)

2. After installation check installed version of node and npm or verify installation by using command: 
- `node -v` / `node --version` 
OR 
- `npm -v` / `npm --version`
