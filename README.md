</p>

- Node is a cross-platform, open-source runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser i.e. at the server. We often use Node to build back-end services ie. API (Application Programming Interface)
- Node is ideally used to build Highly-scalable, data-intensive, real-time back-end services bases applications
- Nodejs is one of the most powerful and popular server technology. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is the core of Nodejs
- Node/Nodejs is open source server environment, it uses JavaScript on server
- Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime/code built on Google Chromes V8 javascript runtime engine. The V8 engine is written in C++ language which takes node(javascript) code and quickly compile/convert to machine code
- Nodejs can be defined/described with the following important terms:
  - Asynchronous
  - Non-blocking
  - Event-Based
  - Single thread / Single-threaded

1.2. Why Node
---------------------

- Great for prototyping and agile development
- Super-fast and highly scalable
- Non-blocking - Asynchronous nature (more tasks/code run at a time)
- JavaScript is a programming language used everywhere (Front-end + Back-end)
- Cleaner and more consistent codebase/source code
- The largest ecosystem of open-source libraries
- Great open-source community support

1.3. What Node can do
---------------------

Node/Nodejs can perform/do the following important things:
- Generate Dynamic page content
- Can Create, Open, Read, Write, Delete files on the server
- Collect Form Data
- Can perform CRUD (Create-Add, Read, Update-Edit/Modify, Delete) operation in Database

1.4. Installing Node
---------------------
1.4. Installing Node/NPM
---------------------
1.4. Install/Setup Node/NPM
---------------------

In this section, we will learn how to set up a local development environment by installing Node/NPM:

- NPM bundled and shift with Nodejs. In order to have NPM on our machine, we just need to download and install Node
- NPM is pre-built with Node/Nodejs so it gets installed automatically - no need to install it separately

1. To verify node/npm available/installed on machine, type command:
    - `node -v` / `node --version` 
    - `npm -v` / `npm --version`
2. If Node not available on machine than download and Install latest nodejs installer as per your OS, and continue installation (website: https://nodejs.org/en)
    - One can install LTS (Long Term Support) verion or current latest version anything is fine

</p>

3. After installation, check installed version of node and npm or verify installation by using command: 
    - To get/check version of node, command: `node -v` / `node --version` 
    OR 
    - To get/check version of npm, command: `npm -v` / `npm --version`

2 Introduction to NPM
=====================

2.1. What is NPM
---------------------

<p align="center">

</p>

- NPM stands for `Node Package Manager `
- It is responsible for managing all the Node.js packages/dependencies and modules present in an application
- NPM comes `bundled with Node/Nodejs`, so it gets installed directly/automatically with Node
- NPM is the default package manager for Node, and it's fully written/coded/developed in JavaScript
- `NPM (Node Package Manager)` is a command-line tool and registry for Third-Party Library(s) which we can add to our Node/Nodejs application
- Node Package Manager is the largest ecosystem (software registry) in the open-source code community. It helps to automate installations and updations of dependent packages
- For any types of functionality, we need to incorporate/add-in application, most probably a free, open-source Node library/package/module available with NPM
- Now a days NPM is a very popular/well-known term among the Web Development community. NPM is a package manager for Node/JavaScript packages or modules
- Developed by `Isaac Z. Schlueter`, initially released in `Jan-2010`

2.2. Package Manager Module Manager
---------------------
2.2. Package Management System
---------------------

### **2.2.1. Package-Module**
---------------------
The package is nothing but just a `collection of code ready to use`, it is usually managed and maintained with a package management system.

Sometimes word Package is alternatively used in place of Module. Package/Module is nothing but a single or bunch of reusable code file(s) wrapped together with a special file named `Package.json`

- **What is a Package?**
  - A Packages contains all the files which are needed for a module(s)
- **What is a Module(s)?**
  - Module(s) are the JavaScript libraries that can be included in Node projects as per the requirement

### **2.2.2. Package Management System**
---------------------

- Software that automates installing and updating packages as and when required
- Package Management System Software deals with what version developer/user needs, and it also manages dependencies

### **2.2.3. Dependencies**
---------------------

- Code/program/Instructions that another set of Code/program depends on to function (Like We use particuler set of code in our app, it is a dependency - our app depends on it. It may be possible that current code depends on some other code and have some other dependencies)

2.3. NPM Role-functionality
---------------------

- It provides an online repository for Node/NodeJs Packages/modules/utilities which we can easily search at
  - (website: https://www.npmjs.com/) 
- It equips/provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) utility to install Node/NodeJs Packages
  - CLI helps/allows the developers to interact with their systems locally also perform version management and dependency management for Node/NodeJs Packages
- NPM allows/helps developers to publish their solution(s) code/package/module into NPM Registry so that other developers facing the same issue can re-use the code by installing the required NPM package/module
- NPM is a way to share code with other developers worldwide, also re-use the code of other developer and easily manage different version of the code base
- Helps to incorporate the pre-built packages into the project
- Assists in downloading various stand-alone tools which can be used any time/right away (adapting any packages as and when the need arises )
- With `npx` we can run and use packages without downloading it
- Developers can share their code with other worldwide NPM users/developers 
- It helps in restricting the code to the specific or particular group of developers (forming virtual team using orgs/organizations)
- Helps in managing and maintaining various versions of codes and their dependencies
- NPM automatically updates the application with the update in the codes

2.4. Advantages of NPM
---------------------

- Completely free and open source
- Simpler than SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- Default package manager of Nodejs
- World's largest software registry (The largest ecosystem of open-source libraries) 
- Fully developed in JavaScript
- Manage local and global dependencies of project/application/tool
- An easy and fast CLI (Command Line Interface) utility to install packages/modules/solutions

3 Getting started with NPM
=====================

3.1. Installing NPM
---------------------
3.1. Install/Setup NPM
---------------------
3.1. Getting/Downloading/Installing/Setting up NPM
---------------------

In this section, we will learn how to set up a local development environment by installing NPM:

- NPM bundled and shift with Nodejs. In order to have NPM on our machine, we just need to download and install Node
- NPM is pre-built with Node/Nodejs so it gets installed automatically - no need to install it separately

1. To verify node/npm available/installed on machine, type command:
    - `node -v` / `node --version` 
    - `npm -v` / `npm --version`
2. If Node not available on machine than download and Install latest nodejs installer as per your OS, and continue installation (website: https://nodejs.org/en)
    - One can install LTS (Long Term Support) verion or current latest version anything is fine

 <figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image - Nodejs website - https://nodejs.org/en</figcaption>
 </figure>
</p>

3. After installation, check installed version of node and npm or verify installation by using command: 
    - To get/check version of node, command: `node -v` / `node --version` 
    OR 
    - To get/check version of npm, command: `npm -v` / `npm --version`

4. To install specific npm version command: 
    - Syntax: `npm install -g npm@version_number`   (`-g` flag is to install globally)
    - Command: `npm install -g npm@x.x.x`,  `npm install -g npm@8.2.1`

5. If any permission error occurs:
    - MacOS
      - Run any node/npm commands as `sudo` or `administrator`, command: `sudo npm install -g` or `sudo npm i -g`

    - Windows
      - Open Command Prompt/Terminal Window with Administrative privileges, Right Click on Terminal (Windows Command Prompt) Icon/Programm -> Choose Run As Administrator

3.2. NPM Help
---------------------
3.2. Getting NPM Help
---------------------

- Getting/Using help with Node/NPM is pretty simple, generally `-h` or `-help` or `--help` flag is used to get/show help about npm or any other npm command
- Syntax: Get NPM help: `npm -h` OR `npm -help` OR `npm --help`
- Syntax: Get any NPM command help: `npm <command_name> -h` OR `npm <command_name> -help` OR `npm <command_name> --help`
- `npm -h` OR `npm -help` OR `npm --help` command shows typical usage of NPM and various sub-flag/options available to use
- Example: To get npm help: `npm -h` OR `npm -help` OR `npm --help`
- Example: To get help of install command: `npm install -h` OR `npm install -help` OR `npm install --help`

3.3. Package.json init
---------------------

### **3.3.1. package json**
---------------------

`Package.json` is an important file for any Node or similar applications, let learn and understand some facts about it:

- For any Node application, the `package.json` file is the heart or main file of the entire application
- `package.json` file is basically the entry point or `manifest file` that contains the generic `metadata`/information about Node application-project in the form of (application name, version, author, license, dependencies, etc.) of the project
- It is present in the `root directory` of any Node/Angular/React or similar application and/or `node_modules` folder, used to define/contains properties of a package (metadata specific to the project)
- If we want to create a public package/module or many peoples working on the same distributed project/package/module then its advisable to create a package.json file at the root of the project
- One can create package.json file with different ways like: 
  - manually 
  - through node/npm command: `npm init`,
  - with yarn command: `yarn init`
- To create package.json file use npm command: `npm init` and answer basics questions related to the application like application name, version, author, license details, project/application description, dependencies, etc.
  - command: `npm init` - initialize the project and create a package.json file
- command: `npm init -y` OR `npm init --yes` (the `-y` or `--yes` flag take default answers of questions and create a package.json file directly)
  - `-y` OR `--yes` flag skips all questions and creates package.json with default values

Each package or dependencies have proper/meaningful version - let us learn about `SemVer or Semantic Versioning` [SemVer](#34-semver) | [Semantic Versioning](#34-semantic-versioning) now!

### **3.3.2. package-lock json**
---------------------

- package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies `node_modules` or `package.json`

### **3.3.3. package json benefits**
---------------------

Package.json files provide the following benefits:
- Holds various metadata relevant to the project
  - contains project-specific metadata/information (application name, version, author, license, dependencies, etc.)
- Manage dependencies of project/application
  - Any package and its version (popular npm packages are: nodemon, express, lodash, moment, etc.)
- Scripts section: (Helps to write initial build scripts for project/application)
  - Commands/Process/Steps to run initially/by dafault
  
### **3.3.4. Basic-Common Project File Folder Structure-Architecture**
---------------------

| **Files/Folders**                   | **Description**                           |
| ------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `**Folders:** `                           |                                           |
| node_modules                              | The packages specified in `package.json` file are installed into this folder (`node_modules`) when we `run npm install` command. Also provides `npm packages/dependencies` to the entire workspace/projects (`node_modules` folder consists of all installed packages mentioned in package.json) |
| `**Files:** `                             |  |
| package.json                              | Contains the packages to build and run our angular application, consists of Node/NPM library/package/module dependencies for application development. Custom script can also be added in as per requirements <br/><br/> **It contains two sets of packages:** <br/>1. **dependencies**: The dependencies are essential for running the application, and <br/>2. **devDependencies**: The devDependencies are only required to develop the application <br/><br/>These packages mentioned in `package.json`  are installed into the `node_modules` folder by the `Node Package Manager (npm)`, when `npm install` command is executed.<br/><br/>`"scripts"` property contains the useful and important `npm commands` needed to run/serve project |
| package-lock.json                         | Provides version information for all packages installed into node_modules by the npm client  |
